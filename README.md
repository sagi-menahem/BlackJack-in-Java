## Game Overview

Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular card games in the world. The objective is simple: beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. This Blackjack game adheres to the standard rules of the game, including:

- A standard deck of 52 playing cards with ranks (Ace, 2, 3, ..., King) and suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).
- Card values: Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.
- Dealing two cards to the player and two cards to the dealer, one face-up and one face-down.
- Player decisions: "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (keep the current hand).
- Dealer's hidden card is revealed when the player stands, and the dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17.
- Determining the winner based on final hand values.
